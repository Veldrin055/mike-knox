      About me

  <div class="w-full text-justify text-gray-700 py-6 px-4 md:text-lg">
    <p>Iâ€™m a creative, empathic, analytical and resilient 36-year-old electronic music artist, freelance data engineer, and a former logistics officer in the Army Reserve. Last December I returned home, having lived abroad in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur for nine years. These experiences exposed me to unique and diverse lifestyles and perspectives not found in Australia.</p>
    <p class="mt-6">My time away from home has instilled profound gratitude for our unique foothills environment and lifestyle, and sense of community found in Ferntree Gully, which has been my family home for 20 years.</p>
    <p class="mt-6">I want to listen to the needs of the community with empathy and provide a way forward that supports the community, nurtures the environment and ensures wellbeing.</p>
